function game() {
    // the different choices either player can make
    const choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"];

    // Math.random picks a random floating point (kind of like decimals) number.
    // Multiplying it by 3 (the number of choices) gives us a floating point
    // number between 0 and 3 (eg. 0.1324 or 2.5452). Finally, Math.floor
    // truncates a floating point number, maing it an Integer. So
    // Math.floor(2.423) would result in 2.
    const index = Math.floor(Math.random(3) * 3);

    // now that we have an integer between 0 and 2, we can use that to pick a
    // random item from the choices array above.

    // Step One: Declare a variable to keep track of whether or not the player
    // won or lost
    var hasWon = false;
    var hasTied = false;

    // Step Two: Write conditional logic which compares the player's choice with
    // the computer's and properly updates the variable you declared in step
    // one.
    //
    // Hints: - you can combine logical expressions with && and ||, where &&
    // means "and" and || means "or". Thus, "false || true" would evaluate to
    // true because only one value needs to be truthy, while "false && true"
    // would evalulate to false because both values need to be truthy.
    //
    // - given the above, this three-part if statement could be written as a
    // single, long conditional expression inside of one if statement. Doing so
    // would be rather difficult to read, however, which is why we have three
    // separate if statements chained together
    if ((playerChoice == "rock") && (computerChoice == "scissors")) {
      hasWon = true;

      hasWon = true;
    } else if (playerChoice == computerChoice) {
      hasTied = true;
    }
    // Step Three: Fix the following string such that the value of
    // computerChoice is inserted after the word "chose" but before the period.
    // That is, if the computer chose "rock", message should have the value "The
    // computer chose rock.\n"
    let message = "The computer chose " + computerChoice + ".\n";

    // Step Four: Write an if statement that, when the player wins, would append
    // "Congrats, you win!" onto the end of message above, and "Sorry, you
    // lose!" when the player loses. As an example, when a player loses, message
    // should look like this (note the newline):
    //
    // The computer chose rock.  Sorry, you lose!
    if (hasWon) {
      message += "Congrats, you win!";
    }
    else if (hasTied){
      message += "You tied, play again."
    } else {
      message += "Sorry, you lose!"
    }

    // Step Five: Open a modal which displays this message to the user.
    alert(message);
